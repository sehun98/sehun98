### Welcome to sehun's Github Story!  👋
👨‍🎓 Most people say. We need to show new technology and unique technology. but I think we should put our own colors into the techniques that have already been created rather than creating something out of nothing. It will be difficult to find your own color. Think about what you like. Think about what you want to do. Think about what you want to be. KEEP TRYING. It is the way I make my life. 

If anyone who visits my website first, plz go to the TIL Repository and try to click Embedded section! You can see how I am studying and what kind of skills that I've learned.

Please visit sehun98.github.io for looking around sehun's portfolio. You can see my life and work that i've done. It will be renewled, but hope you enjoy my trip.

🍭 If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (ohsehun@yonsei.ac.kr) ! Thank you
